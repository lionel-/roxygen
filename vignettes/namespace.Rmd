```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE)
```

The package `NAMESPACE` is one of the most confusing parts of building a package. Roxygen2 aims to make it as easy as possible to build a package that is a well-behaved member of the R ecosystem. This is a little frustrating at first, but soon becomes second-nature.

## Exports

```{r, child = "../man/doc/tags-namespace-exports.md"}
```

## Imports

```{r, child = "../man/doc/tags-namespace-imports.md"}
```
